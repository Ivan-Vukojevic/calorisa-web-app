        "descriptionPart1": "I'm <strong>Sarah</strong>, a Master of Nutrition from <strong>Osijek</strong>, a private <strong>functional training</strong> coach, and a certified <strong>Pilates Reformer instructor</strong>, with a degree obtained in <strong>Munich</strong>, Germany. For over three years, I've been running my own <strong>studio in Osijek's Tvrđa</strong>, a space dedicated to a holistic approach to health and movement.",
        "descriptionPart2": "For me, a healthy lifestyle is more than just a habit and rules — it is the <strong>art of living</strong>. I believe in <strong>balance</strong>, <strong>enjoyment of food and the natural rhythm of the body</strong>. Real change does not come from giving up, but from understanding yourself and your needs, and the best results come from consistency. In my work, I combine <strong>scientifically based principles of nutrition</strong> with <strong>practical training experience</strong>, offering clients a <strong>comprehensive approach</strong> that encompasses body, mind and everyday habits. My goal is to help everyone build a sustainable relationship with nutrition, movement and themselves — without extremes, restrictions or feelings of guilt.",
        "descriptionPart3": "A healthy relationship with food and the body benefits not only the individual, but also the entire family. That's why I believe in the importance of setting an <strong>example for our children</strong> — through simple, sustainable habits and everyday choices that shape a healthier future. In today's world, full of contradictory and unverified information, it's easy to get lost and blocked. That's why it's important to have <strong>guidance that directs you and clear tasks</strong> that lead to real, sustainable results — without confusing trends, but with a focus on what your body really needs.",

Through diagnostics and consultations lasting 60-90 minutes, I aim to gather as much information as possible about your current nutrition and potential improvements. Professional equipment is used for diagnostics - the InBody 120 scale, which brings a completely new dimension to measuring your body: weight measurement, bone and muscle mass, fat, body water percentage, protein and mineral content, visceral fat tissue, and segmental body analysis. Ideally, you should bring recent blood work (not older than 3 months) to the consultation."

Do you have a busy schedule and don't have time to think about what to cook? Want to improve your nutrition or health condition? Want to start training but need motivation and guidance? <strong>Perfect – contact us and let's get started!</strong> You'll receive expert and practical tools, motivation to stay consistent, and constant support."

With each check-in, you get clear insight into where you're progressing and where we can further optimize the approach. I also recommend incorporating regular physical activity – whether it's recreational training, increasing muscle mass or reducing body fat, considering training frequency, intensity, and type of activity (strength, functional training, cardiovascular activities). <strong>My goal is for you to feel confident, motivated, and guided toward the result you want to achieve – with nutrition and training that work for you, not against you.</strong>"
